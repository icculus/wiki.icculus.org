## Remarks

Most of the time, you should only concern yourself with whether a given
operation failed or not, but there may be occasions where you plan to
handle a specific failure case gracefully, so we provide specific error
codes.

Most of these errors are a little vague, and most aren't things you can
fix...if there's a permission error, for example, all you can really do is
pass that information on to the user and let them figure out how to handle
it. In most these cases, your program should only care that it failed to
accomplish its goals, and not care specifically why.

## Version

This enum is available since PhysicsFS 2.1.0.
