# PHYSFS_file

1.0 API compatibility define.

## Deprecated

New code should use [PHYSFS_File](PHYSFS_File), as this #define may go away
someday.

## Header File

Defined in [<physfs.h>](https://github.com/icculus/physfs/blob/main/src/physfs.h)

## Syntax

```c
#define PHYSFS_file PHYSFS_File
```

## Remarks

[PHYSFS_file](PHYSFS_file) is identical to [PHYSFS_File](PHYSFS_File). This
#define is here for backwards compatibility with the 1.0 API, which had an
inconsistent capitalization convention in this case.

## Version

This macro is available since PhysicsFS 1.0.0.
