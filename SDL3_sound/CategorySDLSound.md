# CategorySDLSound

The latest version of SDL_sound can be found at:

https://icculus.org/SDL_sound/

Note that SDL_sound is _not_ an official part of the SDL project, despite
its name.

The basic gist of SDL_sound is that you use an SDL_IOStream to get sound
data into this library, and SDL_sound will take that data, in one of
several popular formats, and decode it into raw waveform data in the format
of your choice. This gives you a nice abstraction for getting sound into
your game or application; just feed it to SDL_sound, and it will handle
decoding and converting, so you can just pass it to your SDL audio callback
(or whatever). Since it gets data from an SDL_IOStream, you can get the
initial sound data from any number of sources: file, memory buffer, network
connection, etc.

As the name implies, this library depends on SDL: Simple Directmedia Layer,
which is a powerful, free, and cross-platform multimedia library. It can be
found at https://www.libsdl.org/

Support is in place for the following sound formats:

- .WAV (Microsoft WAVfile RIFF data, internal.)
- .VOC (Creative Labs' Voice format, internal.)
- .MP3 (MPEG-1 Layer 3 support, via libmpg123.)
- .MID (MIDI music converted to Waveform data, internal.)
- .MOD (MOD files, via internal copy of libModPlug.)
- .OGG (Ogg files, via internal copy of stb_vorbis.)
- .SHN (Shorten files, internal.)
- .RAW (Raw sound data in any format, internal.)
- .AU (Sun's Audio format, internal.)
- .AIFF (Audio Interchange format, internal.)
- .FLAC (Lossless audio compression, via libFLAC.)
